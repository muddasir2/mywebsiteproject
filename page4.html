       1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites <br>
      there is a risk of infringing copyright if someone reproduces someone else's website content on your website without permission, content can include videos, images, sound files, animations, and any other form of media content that the original creator made.  
      It is not copyright infringement if, for example, two people design exactly the same logo completely independently without copying the logo of the other person. Both parties will have copyright protection in their own logo. Therefore, to successfully prove copyright infringement you would first have to show that the other party had access to your materials in order to copy them.

      Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them <br>
      Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.[2]
      
      Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.[2]
      
      Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual
      
      Visually impaired people will need an alternative way of viewing content on a web-page, this can be done through audio files. People with hearing difficulties will need content with audio to be available to read through subtitles. Any content that requires user input in audio format should also be made available to users with speech difficulties, this can be achieved by having an alternative format for user input, such as typing for example.

        Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites <br>
        There are many different image file types available. However every image file type has a specific purpose and only a small number of them can be used on the web.
        websites should use file types that have no compatibility issues, are small, easy to access, and are fully functional for their purpose.
        JPEG and GIFs can both be used to display some type of graphical content on a website. However, 
        JPEG is more suited to photographs and images with a wide array of colour gradients because JPEGs
         can provide millions of colours and very high levels of detail to produce photo-realistic images with relatively low file sizes.
          [3]. GIFs however, should be used for images text or images with blocks of solid colour, because GIFs can reproduce text,
           blocks of solid colour and crisp edges without blurring.
