    1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business <br>
    according to NASDAQ, It’s estimated that by the year 2040, 95% of purchases will be through eCommerce. [1] 
    IT can also be used for digital marketing, which a much cheaper option then alternatives.
    Businesses can reach larger audiences and generate more revenue through social media platforms.
    Also, websites allow a channel for customers to request support for a product they purchased almost 24/7 through web customer service. before the digital age this level of support and customer service was unprecedented.
    Most businesses of the modern era are subject to security threats and vandalism. Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive decisions and other proprietary information that leads to competitive advantages. [2]
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully <br>
   
    Firstly, a plan is needed to complete a project. A valuable resource to start planning ideas and key concepts is using a trello board. This allows you to clearly see what tasks need to be started, and which tasks have been completed.
    You will most likely need some kind of language to create your digital website. E.g. a website would need to be written in HTML, styled using CSS, and if you wanted the website to be interactive and have 'behaviour', JavaScript would also be needed. A text editor would be necessary to write the code in, Visual Studio Code is an excellent text editor that would fit this purpose.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT <br>
    
    Planning out this task will involve the use of trello. (link here). Planning will involve research into good design ideas / patterns which I may draw inspiration from for my own website. To carry out the broader task of building this website I will learn how to use different HTML tags, such as divisions, tables, and forms, and any other html content that is not covered in lessons I will endeavour to study. The same applies for CSS. There is also a possibility of including JavaScript for some finishing touches.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects and what causes their failure <br>
    
    A failure to plan and prepare will certainly increase the risk of projects becoming rushed and incomplete, Even in the process of coding the project, if code is rushed / unclear, it can quickly become messy, leading to more room for bugs and mistakes. If a digital project is worked on by more than 1 person, this also increases a risk of dysfunctional code, because when the code is integrated into a single project or file, there may be compatibility issues, there is also a higher margin for error the more users there are working on a project.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?

    
    I  would research which technologies are more suited for the job I want them to do, I would also consider popularity and ease of access as criteria for selection of software for my project. Sometimes, it is a simple case of trial and error for selecting the right technology, everybody has their preference, and so you must experience an array of technology and systems to find the right one for you.
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    Personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address. [1]
    Under GDPR, it will be easier for individuals to withdraw their consent for data processing.
    This means that digital marketers will only be able to process the data they really need, requiring legal justification for why the personal data they’ve collected is being processed. [2]
    Digital project creators will have to be very diligent with how they handle data so that they are not in breach of any of these new guidelines.
    If companies or organisations are found in breach of these guidelines, they may be issued with penalties; fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros (whichever is greater). [1]
    This may mean extra time spent processing and handling data. Creating and designing systems in place so that customers can easily request to withdraw their data, access their data, or any other matter regarding their personal information that is within the legal guidelines of GDPR.

    <div class="paragraph">
      2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own 
      website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
       <br>
       Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is always being updated with new features, with Microsoft backing and looks to be a future proof text editor.
       it has a very active community with all many plugins that are bespoke to the user.
       VSCode is very fast and responsive
       the only issue with VScode in my experience is
       Default key shortcuts are not user friendly and require reconfiguration for most of the short cut keys.
       Trello allows me to keep tabs on which parts of the assignment are imcomplete and which parts of the assignment are completed and ready to publish, it has served its purpose well.
       
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello <br>
      Visual studio code was adequate for the task at hand as it has integrated features for writing code in HTML and CSS. I don't believe there is any text editor that would be significantly more appropriate to use, given the languages that I am working with. Trello is appropriate because a lot of the bullet point criteria can easily be managed with cards and allows for a quick and easy way to navigate through each card to check the content
     
      
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? 
        You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? <br>
        I've tried to implement all the skills I have learnt in HTML and CSS into this website,
         so in this regard, I believe it is a strong showcase of my talent. It is easy to navigate and has a clear, relaxing aesthetic.
        a weakness of my website would be its lack of interactivity,
        as there is no JavaScript that is written in the source code. JavaScript can allow powerful interactions and inputs from the user, who browses the web-page.
        
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project <br>
        Stylistically, there can be improvements made to the scheme of my web-page, 
        some colours and fonts do not mesh as well as others, and could be changed. 
        The size and padding of certain aspects of the web-page could also be made more proportional and symmetrical for a more pleasant viewing experience. 
        Technically, the addition of JavaScript would make drastic improvements to the web-page, because, as it is, the web-page is rather static. 
        JavaScript would allow content to be more dynamic and more exciting for the user as they can interact with the page in ways that they could not, 
        if the page was just written in HTML and CSS.
        
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose<br>
        All outcomes have been reviewed, and in my opinion, match the details and requirements of the intended purpose. Much of the content on my web-page is in-depth and thorough. They are provided with references to source the knowledge that they exhibit.
