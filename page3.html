      3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of  productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? <br> 
Had I known exactly what I wanted my website to look like and had the tools and resources available on hand to implement my creation, I may have saved half a day at most.
For the most part, I do not believe, given the time given the little time to complete this website, that I could be any more efficient in the websites creation.
This project could have been completed in teams, with each member creating a different page for the website. Whilst it would be more efficient this way, it would leave room for potential clashes in styles, and formatting errors.

      3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency <br>
Waking up  in the morning to exercise, which has scientifically proven to increase focus and concentration, as well as increase the mood would improve productivity.
Staying hydrated and taking regular breaks from the screen is also essential for optimal productivity. An adequate diet rich in essential nutrients and vitamins would also be beneficial for efficiency.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Visual studio code has enabled me to write code in a meticulous fashion, so that I can easily navigate through my code (both HTML and CSS) and see what exactly the function and purpose of each line is, when translated onto a web-page. The internet and search engines, as a technology, has also helped me, with respect to researching different techniques and skills to use and implement into my code for a more satisfying experience for the user.

        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? <br>
I would use slack more to communicate with my assigned tutor, so that I may liaise with him for an optimal strategy to tackle the task at hand. Asking for feedback on regular basis would help me keep track of my progress so that I may not deviate from the goal. If team work was an option, then it would be advantageous, as work-rate would be more efficient and would be enjoyable to work on a project collaboratively.

      <div class="paragraph">
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions <br>
Through trial and error mostly, as this has been a proven method to fix bugs in code for me. I would also give colleagues access to the digital product to test, in however way they see fit, for areas of weakness.
